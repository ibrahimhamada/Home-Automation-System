# Home-Automation-System
*Project of the Embedded Systems Course Offered in Spring 2023 @ Zewail City*

This project aims to demonstrate a comprehensive smart home system that incorporates various functionalities including a solar tracker, gate control, lighting control, fan control , and irrigation system.



## Project Parts:

1. We used Arduino board to serve as the central control unit, coordinating the automation through a range of sensors and actuators. 
2. he solar tracker optimizes the positioning of solar panels by monitoring light intensity. 
3. The gate control system employs a servo motor and ultrasonic sensor for automated gate operation. 
4. The lighting system intelligently adjusts LED brightness based on motion detection and ambient light levels. 
5. The fan system regulates temperature using an LM35 sensor, ensuring optimal comfort. 
6. The irrigation system effectively manages soil moisture levels through a sensor-driven water pump. 
7. With a user-friendly interface and seamless integration of subsystems, this smart home system offers convenience and efficiency for an enhanced living experience.
